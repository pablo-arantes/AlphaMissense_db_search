# AlphaMissense_db_search

This is a repository where you can find a Jupyter notebook script to search on the AlphaMissense database using your Uniprot ID. 

AlphaMissense is a deep learning model that builds on the protein structure prediction tool AlphaFold2. The model is trained on population frequency data and uses sequence and predicted structural context, all of which contribute to its performance. The authors evaluated the model against related methods using clinical databases not included in the training and demonstrated agreement with multiplexed assays of variant effect. Predictions for all singleâ€“amino acid substitutions in the human proteome are provided as a community resource. Here, we implemented an easy way to search and find a prediction for a specific variant or residue on your selected protein.
